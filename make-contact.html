    <h2>Make contact</h2>

    <p>
      Normally here would appear a contact form, but
      I don't have one ready yet. Instead please reach
      out using the social networks/sites to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might also be able to guess an email address.
      I suggest trying hello@ the domain you are currently
      viewing this on.
    </p>

    <h3>Note to recruiters</h3>
    
    <p>
      ðŸ‘‹ It's nice to meet you, but you are not an emergency. 
      I'm happy in my current role, and an unexpected phone
      call is very likely to make a very negative impression
      of both you and your clients. Stick to email!
    </p>
