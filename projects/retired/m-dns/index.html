    <p>
      When I started M DNS there was a surprising lack of DNS services with geographic redundancy,
      sensible APIs and smart pricing. Today, I'm happy to say, many companies offer all of these
      features (and more!). Consequently I have decided to wind down the M DNS service. Source
      code will appear on github at some point.
