    <p>
      This was an app I started in 2007 to make it easier to ingest
      video from firewire compatible (or any input supported by QTKit)
      cameras along with time markers added during recording. The app
      then supported export (with markers) direct to Final Cut Pro.
    </p>

      While it satisfied a need, unfortunately a change of job meant
      I no longer had access to firewire video gear, and really the
      world moved on to HD.
