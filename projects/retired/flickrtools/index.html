      This was a collection of tools (generate a strict DOM compatible photo widget, favourite photographers, and various slideshow tests). These largely relied on a ruby on rails app that has now been retired. Rather than leave these demos in a potentially broken state I've retired them.

      Some of the code is likely to be available on github, either now or in the near future.
