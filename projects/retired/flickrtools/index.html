    <h2><a href="/projects/retired/">Retired</a>: Flickr Tools</h2>

    <p>
      This was a collection of tools (generate a strict DOM compatible
      photo widget, favourite photographers, and various slideshow
      tests). These largely relied on a ruby on rails app that has
      now been retired. Rather than leave these demos in a potentially
      broken state I've retired them.
