    <p>
      This was an app I started in 2007 to make it easier to use USB 3G
      modems with macOS.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it satisfied a need for many years I haven't used a USB 3G
      modem in years, and these devices have evolved (even the ones that
      connect over USB now expose an ethernet interface instead of a 
      pretend serial modem!).
