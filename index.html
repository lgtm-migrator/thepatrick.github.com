    <h2 id="about">About me</h2>

    <p>I am just somebody living in Sydney, Australia.</p>

    <p>
      I currently manage the team that setups and maintains the infrastructure
      that sees routine traffic spikes above 85,000 requests per second and generates
      5TB/day of logs. I'm <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/kasada/de44698a-09a4-46b1-9ec5-c2583d3b2d03">hiring</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love empowering people to design, build and operate scalable, high throughput services.
      I have a strong interest in improving developer experience - especially through automation
      of development and deployment processes.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am interested in different programming languages - I have written code in JavaScript, TypeScript,
      Go, C++, C#, Python, Rust, Scala, Swift and Objective-C. I have wrangled infrastructure with CloudFormation,
      Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, Puppet and Chef. I have wrangled containers with Kubernetes on GKE and EKS.
      I consider running a baremetal k8s cluster fun to do at home.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like doing AV things at events, see <a href="https://twopats.live/">Two Pats</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes I talk at conferences or meetups. When I do I put an entry on the
      <a href="talks">talks</a> page, with links to slides & code.
