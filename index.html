    <h2 id="about">About me</h2>

    <p>I am just somebody living in Sydney, Australia.</p>

    <p>
      I use iPads, Macs and Linux machines, I code in Javascript (both in the browser and with node.js),
      C++, Go, Objective-C and Swift. I fall back to ruby for quick things where node.js hasn't caught up yet.
      I have on occasion used Python. I promised myself never again. I've renegged on that twice.
      I spend most of my time at work wrangling servers with cloudformation, terraform and pulumi and any
      other bit of automation I can glue together.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Sometimes I talk at conferences or meetups. When I do I put an entry on the
      <a href="talks.html">talks</a> page, with links to slides & code.
    </p>
